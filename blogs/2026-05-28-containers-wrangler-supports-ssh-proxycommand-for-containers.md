Wrangler supports using wrangler containers ssh as an OpenSSH ProxyCommand for Containers . This lets your local SSH client connect to a running Container through Wrangler. ssh -o ProxyCommand="wrangler containers ssh %h" cloudchamber@ When standard input and output are piped, Wrangler forwards data to the SSH server in the Container.
