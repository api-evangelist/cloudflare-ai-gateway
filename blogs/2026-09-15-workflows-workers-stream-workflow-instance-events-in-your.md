You can now stream Workflow instance events via WorkflowInstance.subscribe() and the GET /subscribe API endpoint. Workers and HTTP clients can react to workflow and step events, including attempts, sleeps, waits, and rollbacks, without polling for instance status. A subscription first streams the entire event history of the Workflow instance.
